Anyprint
========

Do you commonly forget what language you're writing while typing contrived
print statements? This is the module for you!

Usage
-----

Simply import this module:

```python
import anyprint
```

And start printing rubbish:

```python
printf("printf %d\n", 10);

fmt.Println("hello")

cout << "Hello, C++!" << endl;

Print["Hello from Mathematica!"]

console.log("yes");

System.out.printf("java stuff\n");

Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Ada is cool")
```


Anyprint supports a growing number of languages, and welcomes more!
